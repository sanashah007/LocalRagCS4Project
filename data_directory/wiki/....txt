   The ellipsis (/@|lIpsIs/, plural ellipses; from Ancient Greek:
   lleiqi*s, lleipsis, lit. 'leave out'^[1]), rendered ..., alternatively
   described as suspension points^[2]^: 19 /dots, points^[2]^: 19 /periods
   of ellipsis, or ellipsis points,^[2]^: 19 or colloquially,
   dot-dot-dot,^[not verified in body]^[3]^[4] is a punctuation mark
   consisting of a series of three dots. An ellipsis can be used in many
   ways, such as for intentional omission of text or numbers, to imply a
   concept without using words.^[1] Style guides differ on how to render
   an ellipsis in printed material.

Style

   [edit]

   Opinions differ on how to render an ellipsis in printed material and
   are to some extent based on the technology used for rendering.
   According to The Chicago Manual of Style, it should consist of three
   periods, each separated from its neighbor by a non-breaking space:
   . . ..^[5] According to the AP Stylebook, the periods should be
   rendered with no space between them: ....^[6] A third option -
   available in electronic text - is to use the precomposed character
   U+2026 ... HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS.^[7] When text is omitted following a
   sentence, a period (full stop) terminates the sentence, and a
   subsequent ellipsis indicates one or more omitted sentences before
   continuing a longer quotation. Business Insider magazine suggests this
   style^[8] and it is also used in many academic journals. The Associated
   Press Stylebook favors this approach.^[9]

   When a sentence ends with ellipsis, some style guides indicate there
   should be four dots; three for ellipsis and a period. Chicago advises
   it,^[10] as does the Publication Manual of the American Psychological
   Association (APA style),^[11] while some other style guides do not; the
   Merriam-Webster Dictionary and related works treat this style as
   optional, saying that it "may" be used.^[12]

In writing

   [edit]

   In her book on the ellipsis, Ellipsis in English Literature: Signs of
   Omission, Anne Toner suggests that the first use of the punctuation in
   the English language dates to a 1588 translation of Terence's Andria,
   by Maurice Kyffin.^[3] In this case, however, the ellipsis consists not
   of dots but of short dashes.^[13] "Subpuncting" of medieval manuscripts
   also denotes omitted meaning and may be related.^[14]

   Occasionally, it would be used in pulp fiction and other works of early
   20th-century fiction to denote expletives that would otherwise have
   been censored.^[15]

   An ellipsis may also imply an unstated alternative indicated by
   context. For example, "I never drink wine ..." implies that the speaker
   does drink something else--such as vodka.

   In reported speech, the ellipsis can be used to represent an
   intentional silence.

   In poetry, an ellipsis is used as a thought-pause or line break at the
   caesura^[16] or this is used to highlight sarcasm or make the reader
   think about the last points in the poem.

   In news reporting, often put inside square brackets, it is used to
   indicate that a quotation has been condensed for space, brevity or
   relevance, as in "The President said that [...] he would not be
   satisfied", where the exact quotation was "The President said that, for
   as long as this situation continued, he would not be satisfied".

   Herb Caen, Pulitzer-prize-winning columnist for the San Francisco
   Chronicle, became famous for his "three-dot journalism".^[17]

   Depending on context, ellipsis can indicate an unfinished thought, a
   leading statement, a slight pause, an echoing voice, or a nervous or
   awkward silence. Aposiopesis is the use of an ellipsis to trail off
   into silence--for example: "But I thought he was..." When placed at the
   end of a sentence, an ellipsis may be used to suggest melancholy or
   longing.^[18]

   In newspaper and magazine columns, ellipses may separate items of a
   list instead of paragraph breaks.^[2]^: 21

   Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writers and Editors uses a line of
   ellipsis to indicate omission of whole lines in a quoted poem.^[2]^:
   147

In different languages

   [edit]

In English

   [edit]

American English

   [edit]

   The Chicago Manual of Style suggests the use of an ellipsis for any
   omitted word, phrase, line, or paragraph from within but not at the end
   of a quoted passage. There are two commonly used methods of using
   ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one
   makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three
   dots: . . .) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a
   space followed by three dots: . ...). The Chicago Style Q&A recommends
   that writers avoid using the precomposed ... (U+2026) character in
   manuscripts and to place three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces
   (. . .) instead, leaving the editor, publisher, or typographer to
   replace them later.^[19]

   The Modern Language Association (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis
   must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an
   ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, square brackets must
   surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the
   original quote: [ . . . ]. Currently, the MLA has removed the
   requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain
   that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears
   confusion.^[20]

   The MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis  . . .  should
   be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote.
   When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so
   that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except
   for before the first dot) ellipsis . . . .  should be used. When
   ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are
   not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in
   square brackets (e.g. text [...] text).^[21]^[22]

   According to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to
   condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in
   speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such
   as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened
   sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with
   an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When
   material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately
   following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at
   the beginning of the next, according to this style.^[23]

   According to Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style, the
   details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the
   font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that
   a full space between each dot is "another Victorian eccentricity. In
   most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide"--he recommends
   using flush dots (with a normal word space before and after), or
   thin-spaced dots (up to one-fifth of an em), or the prefabricated
   ellipsis character U+2026
   ... HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS (&hellip;, &mldr;). Bringhurst suggests that
   normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from
   the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading
   space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual
   practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:

   i ... j k.... l..., l l, ... l m...? n...!

   In legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the Bluebook
   citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before
   the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends
   the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space,
   followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal
   writing, an ellipsis is written as three asterisks, *** or * * *, to
   make it obvious that text has been omitted or to signal that the
   omitted text extends beyond the end of the paragraph.

British English

   [edit]

   The Oxford Style Guide recommends setting the ellipsis as a single
   character ... or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots surrounded
   by spaces, thus:  . . . . If there is an ellipsis at the end of an
   incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is
   retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two
   complete sentences.^[24]

   The ... fox jumps ...
   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. ... And if they have not
   died, they are still alive today.
   It is not cold ... it is freezing cold.

   Contrary to The Oxford Style Guide, the University of Oxford Style
   Guide demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when
   it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis
   (but not before). An ellipsis is never preceded or followed by a full
   stop.^[25]

   The...fox jumps...
   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog...And if they have not
   died, they are still alive today.
   It is not cold... it is freezing cold.

In Polish

   [edit]

   When applied in Polish syntax, the ellipsis is called wielokropek,
   literally 'multidot'. The word wielokropek distinguishes the ellipsis
   of Polish syntax from that of mathematical notation, in which it is
   known as an elipsa. When an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a
   quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets.
   An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.
   The syntactic rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska
   Norma document PN-83/P-55366, Zasady skl/adania tekstw w jezyku
   polskim (Rules for Setting Texts in Polish).

In Russian

   [edit]

   The combination "ellipsis+period" is replaced by the ellipsis. The
   combinations "ellipsis+exclamation mark" and "ellipsis+question mark"
   are written in this way: !.. ?..

In Japanese

   [edit]

   The most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called 3-ten
   rida ("3-dot leaders", ...). 2-ten rida exists as a character, but it
   is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six
   dots (two 3-ten rida characters, ......). Three dots (one 3-ten rida
   character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header.
   However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally
   written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text
   height (between the baseline and the ascent line), as in the standard
   Japanese Windows fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always
   centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced
   "ten", the dots are colloquially called "ten-ten-ten" (ten5ten5ten5,
   akin to the English "dot dot dot").^[26]^[27]

   In text in Japanese media, such as in manga or video games, ellipses
   are much more frequent than in English, and are often changed to
   another punctuation sign in translation. The ellipsis by itself
   represents speechlessness, or a "pregnant pause". Depending on the
   context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an
   expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or
   actions.^[28] As a device, the ten-ten-ten is intended to focus the
   reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any
   dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative "camera"
   on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or
   action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects "speaking" the
   ellipsis.

In Chinese

   [edit]

   In Chinese, the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots,
   occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters). In
   horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered
   along the midline (halfway between the Roman descent and Roman ascent,
   or equivalently halfway between the Roman baseline and the capital
   height, i.e. .3.3). This is generally true of Traditional Chinese,
   while Simplified Chinese tends to have the ellipses aligned with the
   baseline;^[29] in vertically written text the dots are always centered
   horizontally (i.e. Chinese:
   ).^[30] Also note that Taiwan and Mainland China have different
   punctuation standards.^[29]

In Spanish

   [edit]

   In Spanish, the ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of et cetera
   at the end of unfinished lists. So it means "and so forth" or "and
   other things".

   Other use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a
   phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or
   implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the
   complete use of expletives.

   When the ellipsis is placed alone into a parenthesis (...) or--less
   often--between brackets [...], which is what happens usually within a
   text transcription, it means the original text had more contents on the
   same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription.
   When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text,
   the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.

   The number of dots is three and only three.^[31] They should have no
   space in between them nor with the preceding word, but there should be
   an space with the following word (except if they are followed by a
   punctuation sign, such as a comma).^[31]

In French

   [edit]

   In French, the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to
   represent et cetera. In French typography, the ellipsis is written
   immediately after the preceding word, but has a space after it, for
   example: comme a... pas comme ceci. If, exceptionally, it begins a
   sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: Lui ? ...
   vaut rien, je crois.... However, any omitted word, phrase or line at
   the end of a quoted passage would be indicated as follows: [...] (space
   before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: ...
    Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse [...].

In German

   [edit]

   In German, the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it
   stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no
   space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it
   stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the
   written letter or letters.

   Example for both cases, using German style: The first el...is stands
   for omitted letters, the second ... for an omitted word.

   If the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is
   omitted.^[32]

   Example: I think that ...

In Italian

   [edit]

   The Accademia della Crusca suggests the use of an ellipsis ("puntini di
   sospensione") to indicate a pause longer than a period and, when placed
   between brackets, the omission of letters, words or phrases.^[33]

     "Tra le cose pi preziose possedute da Andrea Sperelli era una
     coperta di seta fina, d'un colore azzurro disfatto, intorno a cui
     giravano i dodici segni dello Zodiaco in ricamo, con le
     denominazioni [...] a caratteri gotici." (Gabriele D'Annunzio, Il
     piacere)^[34]

In mathematical notation

   [edit]

   An ellipsis is used in mathematics to mean "and so forth"; usually
   indicating the omission of terms that follow an obvious pattern as
   indicated by included terms.

   The whole numbers from 1 to 100 can be shown as:

          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
          displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mn>1</mn> <mo>,</mo>
          <mn>2</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>3</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mo>...</mo>
          <mo>,</mo> <mn>100</mn> </mstyle> </mrow> <annotation
          encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle 1,2,3,\ldots
          ,100}</annotation> </semantics> :MATH]
          {\displaystyle 1,2,3,\ldots ,100}

   The positive whole numbers, an infinite list, can be shown as:

          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
          displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mn>1</mn> <mo>,</mo>

          encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle 1,2,3,\ldots
          }</annotation> </semantics> :MATH]
          {\displaystyle 1,2,3,\ldots }

   To indicate omitted terms in a repeated operation, an ellipsis is
   sometimes raised from the baseline, as:^[2]^: 115

          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
          displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mn>1</mn> <mo>+</mo>
          <mn>2</mn> <mo>+</mo> <mn>3</mn> <mo>+</mo> <mo>.3</mo>
          <mo>+</mo> <mn>100</mn> </mstyle> </mrow> <annotation
          encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle 1+2+3+\cdots
          +100}</annotation> </semantics> :MATH]
          {\displaystyle 1+2+3+\cdots +100}

   But, this raised formatting is not standard. For example, Russian
   mathematical texts use the baseline format.^[35]

   The ellipsis is not a formally defined mathematical symbol. Repeated
   summations or products may be more formally denoted using capital sigma
   and capital pi notation, respectively:

          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle

          _{n=1}^{100}n=100!} (see factorial)

   Ellipsis is sometimes used where the pattern is not clear. For example,
   indicating the indefinite continuation of an irrational number such as:

          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
          displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mi>p</mi> <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>3.14159265</mn> <mo>...</mo> </mstyle> </mrow> <annotation
          encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle \pi
          =3.14159265\ldots }</annotation> </semantics> :MATH]
          {\displaystyle \pi =3.14159265\ldots }

   It can be useful to display an expression compactly, for example:

   In set notation, the ellipsis is used as horizontal, vertical and
   diagonal for indicating missing matrix terms, such as the size-n
   identity matrix:

In computer programming

   [edit]

   Some programming languages use ellipsis to indicate a range or for a
   variable argument list.

   The CSS text-overflow property can be set to ellipsis, which cuts off
   text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.^[36]^[37]

In computer user interface

   [edit]

More

   [edit]

   An ellipsis is sometimes used as the label for a button to access user
   interface that has been omitted - probably due to space limitations -
   particularly in mobile apps running on small screen devices. This may
   be described as a "more button".^[38]

   Similar functionality may be accessible via a button with a hamburger
   icon (=3) or a narrow version called the kebab icon which is a vertical
   ellipsis (:3).

More info needed

   [edit]

   According to some style guides, a menu item or button labeled with a
   trailing ellipsis requests an operation that cannot be completed
   without additional information and selecting it will prompt the user
   for input.^[39] Without an ellipsis, selecting the item or button will
   perform an action without user input.
   [220px-Menu_%28computing%29_example.PNG] A drop-down menu of file
   operations

   For example, the menu item "Save" overwrites an existing file whereas
   "Save as..." prompts the user for save options before saving.

Busy/progress

   [edit]

   Ellipsis is commonly used to indicate that a longer-lasting operation
   is in progress like "Loading...", "Saving...".

   Sometimes progress is animated with an ellipse-like construct of
   repeatedly adding dots to a label.

In texting

   [edit]

   In text-based communications, the ellipsis may indicate:
     * Floor holding, signal that more is to come, for instance when
       people break up longer turns in chat.^[40]
     * Politeness, for instance indicating topic change or
       hesitation.^[41]
     * Turn construction unit to signal silence, for example when
       indicating disagreement, disapproval or confusion.^[42]

   Although an ellipsis is complete with three periods (...), an
   ellipsis-like construct with more dots is used to indicate
   "trailing-off" or "silence".^[43] The extent of repetition in itself
   might serve as an additional contextualization or paralinguistic cue;
   one paper wrote that they "extend the lexical meaning of the words, add
   character to the sentences, and allow fine-tuning and personalisation
   of the message".^[44]

   While composing a text message, some environments show others in the
   conversation a typing awareness indicator ellipsis to indicate remote
   activity.^[45]

Computer representations

   [edit]

   In computing, several ellipsis characters have been codified.

Unicode

   [edit]

   Unicode defines the following ellipsis characters:
     * U+2026 ... HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
     * U+0EAF &#xeaf; LAO ELLIPSIS
     * U+1801 &#x1801; MONGOLIAN ELLIPSIS
     * U+0E2F &#xe2f; THAI CHARACTER PAIYANNOI
     * U+22EE :3 VERTICAL ELLIPSIS
     * U+22EF .3 MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
     * U+22F0 &#x22f0; UP RIGHT DIAGONAL ELLIPSIS
     * U+22F1 &#x22f1; DOWN RIGHT DIAGONAL ELLIPSIS
     * U+FE19 &#xfe19; PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS

   Unicode recognizes a series of three period characters (U+002E
   . FULL STOP) as compatibility equivalent (though not canonical) to the
   horizontal ellipsis character.^[46]

HTML

   [edit]

   In HTML, the horizontal ellipsis character may be represented by the
   entity reference &hellip; (since HTML 4.0), and the vertical ellipsis
   character by the entity reference &vellip; (since HTML 5.0).^[47]
   Alternatively, in HTML, XML, and SGML, a numeric character reference
   such as &#x2026; or &#8230; can be used.

TeX

   [edit]

   In the TeX typesetting system, the following types of ellipsis are
   available:

   In LaTeX, the reverse orientation of \ddots can be achieved with
   \reflectbox provided by the graphicx package: \reflectbox{\ddots}
   yields [18px-Iddots_black.svg.png] .

   With the amsmath package from AMS-LaTeX, more specific ellipses are
   provided for math mode.^[48]

Other

   [edit]

   The horizontal ellipsis character also appears in older character maps:
     * in Windows-1250--Windows-1258 and in IBM/MS-DOS Code page 874, at
       code 85 (hexadecimal)
     * in Mac-Roman, Mac-CentEuro and several other Macintosh encodings,
       at code C9 (hexadecimal)
     * in Ventura International encoding at code C1 (hexadecimal)

   Note that ISO/IEC 8859 encoding series provides no code point for
   ellipsis.

   As with all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range, the
   author, sender and receiver of an encoded ellipsis must be in agreement
   upon what bytes are being used to represent the character. Naive text
   processing software may improperly assume that a particular encoding is
   being used, resulting in mojibake.

Input

   [edit]

   In Windows using a suitable code page, U+2026
   ... HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS can be inserted with Alt+0133, using the
   numeric keypad.

   In macOS, it can be inserted with
   OPT Opt+; (on an English language keyboard).

   In some Linux distributions, it can be inserted with
   AltGr+. (this produces an interpunct on other systems), or Compose...

   In Android, ellipsis is a long-press key. If Gboard is in alphanumeric
   layout, change to numeric and special characters layout by pressing
   ?123 from alphanumeric layout. Once in numeric and special characters
   layout, long press . key to insert an ellipsis. This is a single symbol
   without spaces in between the three dots ( ... ).

   In Chinese and sometimes in Japanese, ellipsis characters are made by
   entering two consecutive horizontal ellipses, each with Unicode code
   point U+2026. In vertical texts, the application should rotate the
   symbol accordingly.
